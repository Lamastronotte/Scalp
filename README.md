# Scalp

I'm working on that project and it's not finished now

Scalp is an injector and executor for roblox

I'm using ImGui with c++ for this project.
Currently to inject dlls i'm using LoadLibA but i'm finding a way to use manual mapping.
I did some of the Ui but not everything.

I'm currently working on the executor ui.

Some other details:
llai stands for loadlibA injection, I just made some code so i need to call just one function to inject a dll.
Use the filters of visual studio because it's better, if you see the files, they're not in directories because i put  them into filters of visual studio
